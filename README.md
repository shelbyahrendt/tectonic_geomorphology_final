## Analyzing river profile concavity in the Snohomish & Stillaguamish basins
This notebook was created as part of a final project for Alison Duvall's tectonic geomorphology class. It imports DEMs of the Snohomish and Stillaguamish basin using landlab and extracts the channel network. These profiles are then compared against an idealized profile created using Hack's law with expected ks and theta values.

The goal of this project was to estimate how much uplift would be necessary to erase the concavity difference between the Cascade Mtn regions and lowland Puget Sound. This concavity difference reflects river disequillibrium in response to the last continental glaciation.
